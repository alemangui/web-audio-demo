#Web audio demo

This demo was created for a presentation at the [Paris.JS](http://parisjs.org/) and [Code Algorithm Processing Dream Paris](http://www.meetup.com/Code-Algorithm-Processing-Dream-Paris/) meetups. A working version can be found [here](http://alemangui.github.io/web-audio-demo/).

## Leap motion device

If you have a Leap Motion device, connect it and you will be able to create higher pitches by raising your hand and lower ones by lowering it.

## Keyboard
Start drum beat with 'q'. Keys 'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k' and 'l' create sounds in the scale of G.

## External resources 
This demo uses [Pizzicato.JS](https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato) and [Leap.JS](http://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs/).
